* Check the Report.pdf for further information about the methods

* To run the scripts and the analysis, open the folder Final_Session_I_code and source cloud.sh library. and simply run the scrips with:

    >> bash part_x.sh

    ATTENTION! 
    --- To build the library without the implementation for buckets remove the file cloudset.sh from the folder before sourcing cloud.sh library.
